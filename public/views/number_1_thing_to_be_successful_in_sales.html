                    Great sales, like public relations, can be summed up with one important key point:
                </p>
                <strong>
                    Understand the self interest of other people and find ways to align it with your own.
                </strong>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Story Time</h2>

                <p>
                    In my junior year, I was fortunate enough to be picked for a prestigious internship with Edelman,
                    the #1 Public Relations firm in the world. For this internship, we worked for the styrofoam
                    industry in California and tried to fight negative styrofoam legislation that was forming in the
                    California legislature.
                </p>


                <p>
                    We need a local group who could help us in our cause. Using our knowledge from school, my team
                    and I brainstormed on who’s self interest we could align with to help fight this legislation.
                    Styrofoam was cheap whereas the alternative was very expensive to produce and purchase. Who would
                    be hurt most by having to pay more for styrofoam? Then it hit us: It was the small restaurant
                    business. We had found our ally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That summer, my team and I spoke to every small restaurant business in Los Angeles county. If
                    their take out boxes used styrofoam, we spoke with them. Our pitch was simple: “Legislation was
                    trying to ban styrofoam and replace it with a much more expensive alternative. Can you take a
                    moment to write your congressperson and tell them how you feel?”
                </p>

                <p>
                    It worked. We sent in hundreds of letters from restaurant businesses in LA County to their
                    legislatures. Because of our efforts, the negative styrofoam legislation was not signed that year.
                    By using the principle of aligning self interest, we were able to find an ally in the fight to
                    help accomplish our goal.
                </p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Take Home Message</h2>

                <p>
                    Henry Ford once said:
                </p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">“If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get
                    the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your
                    own.”
                </blockquote>

                    <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/ford.jpg" alt="">
                </a>

                <p>
                    As simple as this sounds, your average salesperson does not do this. The next time you
                    speak with a potential customer, think of their needs. What problems or issues do they have?
                    How can your product or service solve that pain point?
                </p>

                <p>
                    But remember: Be genuine. If you do not genuinely care about the potential customer and their
                    problem, this method does not work. Potential customers can detect fake sympathy a mile away. Be
                    sincere and seek to solve their problems. If you do this, you will be a successful salesperson.
                </p>
