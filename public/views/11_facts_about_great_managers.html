                        There is no secret or hack to being a great manager. It takes time, effort and sincerity. I learned this lesson the hard
                        way.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I first became a supervisor, I was only managing one employee. But, after seven months of massive growth, my team grew
                        to five people. As the team continued to grow, I read every blog post I could find about management.
                        I tried to find out what structure or management style worked best. In the end, I found there is
                        not one secret answer to excellent management. Instead, there are small essential things you must
                        do to be a great manager and get the most out of your team.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Below I will include a list of things I have found work great to create a stable team. There is no particular order to any
                        of the points listed below. To avoid being overwhelmed, I recommend you pick a few to focus on for
                        a few weeks and add on as you continue to grow. Remember excellent management does not happen all
                        at once! It takes time.
                    </p>

                            Hold one-on-ones weekly with each employee. To read on how to conduct an effective one-on-one,

                        <li>
                            Use "we" instead of "I" when speaking to and about your team. Great managers think of everyone as a team. It is not what
                            I am doing; it's what we as a team are doing.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            When things go well, your team did it, and they deserve all the credit. When things go poorly, it is your fault, and you
                            deserve all the blame.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Have a budget for you and your team to do an activity once a month during the work day (you heard me). I truly believe it
                            is essential to take a break from work and do something fun together. This could be a movie,
                            dinner at a nice restaurant, laser tag, etc. Show your team they matter. Do something fun monthly.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Everyone on your team should have a bonus structure regardless of position. Sales positions should always have the highest
                            bonus. The harder the job and more important to revenue, the higher the reward.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Your own personal bonus structure should align perfectly with your team's goals and bonuses. If your team succeeds, you succeed.
                            If your team fails, you fail.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Admit when you are wrong. Do not hide this from your team.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            Praise in public and criticize in private. Let everyone know what you admire about the members of your team. Additionally,
                            no one in your organization should ever be humiliated in front of everyone else. Respect their
                            dignity.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            It is your job to set the expectations (goals) for your team, and it is the job of your team members to accomplish them.
                            If they exceed the goals for the quarter, reward them for it.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            The job of a manager is to remove all obstacles that impede his or her team from accomplishing their goals. If that means
                            taking specific calls or doing particular menial tasks, then so be it. Nothing is beneath a great
                            manager who is looking out for his or her team.
