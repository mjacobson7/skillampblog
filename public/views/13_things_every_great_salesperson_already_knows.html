                    <ol>
                        <li>Don’t use the term “love” when speaking with or emailing clients. Use “like,” “happy to,” or “appreciate” instead.</li><br>
                        <li>Do not interrupt clients when they are speaking. It may sound obvious, but you would be surprised how many salespeople do this. Yes, it means your calls or meetings with clients will be a bit longer, but it is worth it because you learn much more about the client. Like Robert Breault said, “Looking back, you realize everything would have explained itself if you had only stopped interrupting.”</li><br>
                        <li>Make your email personal. Having a template for each email is nice but be sure to personalize each one somehow. Add something unique to each email, so they know they got a personal message.</li><br>
                        <li>Check your grammar. There are a lot of great tools out there that can help you. I prefer Grammarly. The company has a free version or a paid version. Both of them are great. Regardless of the apps, always proofread your work before sending it. Never send an email or message without reading it first.</li><br>
                        <li>Prepare for a call with a client. Even if it is only a few seconds, it is essential to compose yourself. If you have time and info on the client, look at the company website or the city where the person is based. Anything unique about it that you would like to share or ask? If you are dealing with inbound calls, you do not have time to research, but you still can take a few seconds before the call to compose yourself and remember to make the call unique.</li><br>
                        <li>Start out every sales call with a personal comment. This has been immersible in helping me build rapport with new clients. However, it only works if you are genuine. I break down how to do this in my previous post.</li><br>
                        <li>Seek always to align self-interest. Everyone is motivated by their self-interest. Your self-interest is to sell the product. Seek to find the self-interest of your clients. What are they driven by and what do they genuinely care about? Find out what it is and find ways to align it with the product you are selling. If your product genuinely helps the consumer and you can paint that picture, you will be successful.</li><br>
                        <li>Do not always say “uh-huh,” “ok,” “right” or any other nonsense words when a client is speaking with you. This is one of the most annoying things I encounter. These are what I call “micro interruptions.” If you have this problem, have friends and family help you fix it. Record yourself going through your sales pitch. It will help you recognize the problem. Once you hear it, focus on fixing it. It is a habit. And, like other habits, it can be broken. </li><br>
                        <li>Write it down. If you do not write it down, you will forget it. Everyone has a method for remembering things. Some use phone apps, calendars, post-it notes, etc.… Whatever your process, be sure to write it down. This will help keep your promises to clients, employees or family and make you a better person.</li><br>
                        <li>Fail fast. This is probably the best advice I got for career advancement. You do not learn from your successes. You learn from your failures. If you want to be successful, you will need to fail faster and more often than ever before. Ignore the thoughts of self-doubt. Every great person had to fail to succeed and you can too!</li><br>
                        <li>Don’t use your phone in the bathroom. It is probably common knowledge now that bathroom times have increased dramatically since the smartphone came out. Remember apps like Facebook have feeds that are designed to keep your scrolling forever. Don’t.</li><br>
                        <li>Take Breaks. This may seem like I am contradicting #11, but breaks are important. Walk around the office for a bit. Go to a window or go outside. It is amazing what a quick 5-minute break will do to your morale.</li><br>
                        <li>Ask for advice. Pride is kryptonite for a great salesperson. Do not let it get you. Ask advice from everyone you know. Ask your supervisors or managers for help. Do not be afraid to ask for help.</li>
                    </ol>
